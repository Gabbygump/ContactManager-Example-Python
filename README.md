### Example OpenSource development repository ###

is directly copied from there.
This repository does not contain any intentional issues to fix.


### Description ###
This is a simple console based contact manager.  The manager will read contacts from a CSV file (fname, lname, email) and print, search, add, and delete contacts as well as write the contacts back to a file.

The code is written in Python.  This code was originally produced on Mac OS X 10.8.5 using JEdit 5.1.0.  On April 28, 2014, it was updated to use Python3.4.0 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using VIM.
