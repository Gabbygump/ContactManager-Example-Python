### Example OpenSource development repository ###

This repository is based on ContactManager-Example-C.  Some of the information
is directly copied from there.
This repository does not contain any intentional issues to fix.


### Description ###
This is a simple console based contact manager.  The manager will read contacts from a CSV file (fname, lname, email) and print, search, add, and delete contacts as well as write the contacts back to a file.

The code is written in Python and contains the necessary files for an Eclipse project.  (This code was produced on Mac OS X 10.8.5 using Eclipse Kepler).
